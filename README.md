## Image Tagger

Implemented as a tool for using during my dissertation for my MSc in Big Data Analytics. This app is used to mark up images with a mesh of the terrain types shown in them. Images are loaded fom S3, tagged image data is saved back there.

This project was built using AWS Amplify, and has Python Lambda back-end and a Javascript front-end
